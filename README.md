# 🧠 Memory Game

A modern browser-based Memory card game built with **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, and powered by **Vite**.

---

## Description

Memory Game is an interactive web application where players flip cards to find matching pairs.

The project focuses on implementing game logic with TypeScript, structuring code in a modular way, and styling a responsive interface using SCSS. Vite is used as a modern build tool to enable fast development and optimized production builds.

The application demonstrates state management, DOM manipulation, event handling, and clean project architecture.
